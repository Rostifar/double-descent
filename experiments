1. CIFAR-10 w/ Resnet18
    [] No label noise (w/ Adam LR=0.0001; 4k epochs; data augmentation)
    [] label noise at various levels
    [] epoch-wise double descent (k=3, 12, 64); 20% noise; epochs=[1, 10, 100, 500, 1000]


Data Augmentation:
    - RandomCrop(32, padding=4)
    - RandomHorizontalFlip
    * Noisy labels given same label

Batch Size: 128 (this might have to be reduced)

Noise: [0, 5, 10, 15, 20]
